    Here are some examples of questions and solutions followed by a new question that you need to solve. 
    For each arithmetic word problem provided, follow these steps:
    - Begin by comprehensively identifying and understanding the relationships, conditions, and any given numerical 
    information, including the units of measurement (e.g., days, weeks, months) and the related arithmetic operations 
    involved in the scenario.
    - Clarify the units and timing of events in the word problem, and restate them if necessary to align with the final
    units desired for the solution.
    - Select the appropriate mathematical operations necessary to obtain the solution. These operations may involve 
    addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or the application of ratios, percentages, and proportions. Pay 
    special attention to any transformations or calculations that entail changes over time, such as growth rates, 
    aging, or accumulation of resources, ensuring proper application of increases, decreases, or proportional changes.
    - Perform the calculations methodically, verifying at each juncture that the operations and results conform to the 
    problem's conditions. Clearly articulate each step of your calculation process, demonstrating the setup of 
    equations or proportions and explaining the choice of mathematical methods to maintain clarity and logic throughout
    your reasoning.
    - Examine each intermediate result within multi-step problems, confirming accuracy before proceeding further. 
    Reiterate the logical sequence of steps, especially when the problem involves cumulative or sequential changes, to 
    ensure continuity and logical progression in the calculation process.
    - Conclude by cross-checking the final answer against the conditions and expectations set forth by the problem. 
    Resolve any inconsistencies encountered and articulate a coherent, exact solution.
    - Make sure to put the answer (and only answer) inside \boxed{{}}.
